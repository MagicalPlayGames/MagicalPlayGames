## Hi there, I'm Michael üßîüñ•Ô∏è üëã

Thank you for checking out my Github. I've been coding for 12 years now, and I am currently pursuing my Unity Expert Programmer Certification.

I have various projects here to check out ranging from Advance A.I. to games I've developed. Please have a look and feel free to add onto the code.
Also, here are some Art I've done using Unity Shaders
